Idea behind Onwebed
===================

When using Onwebed, you've to assume that most objects consist of other objects. For example, a website is just a bunch of pages. Onwebed is not only designed to build websites and manage its content, you can easily store other forms of content too. For instance, you can store the list of questions you got to solve for your homework. Flexibility is the key idea behind Onwebed.

##Pages
As stated before, in Onwebed a website is just a combination of pages. A page, on the other side, is a combination of bunch of objects called **blocks**, each serving a role.
Let's consider an example of a simple page which will have:
-a header
-a main menu
-a body
-a footer
Each of the components are just blocks in Onwebed.
